Performing arithmetic between :class:`datetime.datetime` subclasses and
:class:`datetime.timedelta` now returns an object of the same type as the
:class:`datetime.datetime` subclass. As a result,
:meth:`datetime.datetime.astimezone` and alternate constructors like
:meth:`datetime.datetime.now` and :meth:`datetime.fromtimestamp` called with
a ``tz`` argument now *also* retain their subclass.
