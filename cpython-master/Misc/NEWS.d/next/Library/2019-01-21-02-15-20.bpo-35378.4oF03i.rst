Fix a reference issue inside :class:`multiprocessing.Pool` that caused
the pool to remain alive if it was deleted without being closed or
terminated explicitly. A new strong reference is added to the pool
iterators to link the lifetime of the pool to the lifetime of its
iterators so the pool does not get destroyed if a pool iterator is
still alive.
