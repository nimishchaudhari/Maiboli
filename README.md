# Maiboli

This repository is the working module of **Maiboli - A multi-linguistic programming language solution**. 
This system is based on Python programming language and it covers up basic libraries required for one to learn programming as a concept, in their native language. This repository hosts the web service (under development) that shall host the same system on a server, allowing users to make ***REST API*** to access data. 

This web service was built with the usage of [Swagger UI](https://editor.swagger.io/) which helped me by exporting the specification into a python flask kit.

A research paper sharing the insights of Maiboli as a programming method, can serve for the well being of common individuals not understanding English, but wishing to learn python programming is published [here](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8973043).
