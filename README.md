#maiboli

Maiboli is an attempt to allow users to write python code in Marathi Devanagari Script

Working:
This build is an attempt to make a parser that will take input text from the user in filename.py format, run a text parser that will convert all the marathi terms into english python function terms.

Then this parsed text will be copied in a new file, that will be then executed by the python compiler to run and show output as per the program.


TO TRY, WRITE code in MARATHI as PYTHON's syntax

to execute: python p.py filename.py
e.g. 
python3 p.py Test.py


PYTHON 3 needed for operation!
